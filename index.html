                Amid the engine noise and tire smoke, an idea was sparked – one that would become the Arabian Gazelles, Dubai's first all-female supercar club

        <h1 id="who">About Hanan</h1>
        <p>
        Born in Algeria, Sobati moved to Britain, Qatar, and then resettled in the UAE for almost 25 years. With a passion for sports cars, she previously took part in the Rallye des ­Princesses, a women's rally event in France. As a mother of two teenage daughters, she wanted to empower women through driving in a male-dominated industry, so, in 2016, she decided to launch the Arabian Gazelles with involvement of other women who were fellow car enthusiasts. According to an interview carried out by aeworld.com, this brought happiness and the feeling of reward to Sobati, and had the support of her husband, family members, and friends.

        <h1 id="what">The Inspiration</h1>
        <p>
            One of the main reasons was my growing frustration with the automotive industry and the way women were overlooked in this male-dominated sector, nobody was doing anything about it! So, I decided to set up the club which evolved into a platform of like-minded women passionate about driving change.

        <p>
            The industry has been slow to recognize the buying power of women, but they’re now recognizing this is a massive segment. We have a voice and a seat at the table. Luxury car manufacturers are discovering the power of women buyers, setting up female advisory boards and panels to review current and future products and give feedback to shape vehicles, the shift is also reflected in hiring women in this industry – celebrating women engineers and industry’s leaders. Luxury carmakers host female-focused events and track days.It has clearly evolved and it’s only the beginning.

        </div>
        <p>
            Any collective work of empowered women will break barriers. We set up as a car club and have grown into a platform a community of passionate women driving for change and paving the way for others to look for their passion and fuel it. We have a voice and we use it to normalize women buying, driving and enjoying their passion for supercars, banishing old cliches and tired assumptions. We now have more than 100 ladies from 26 different countries and backgrounds, ranging from doctors, artists, lawyers, pilots, housewives and CEOs and we all share this passion to connect, bond, network and build businesses together!
